# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the project! To make the contribution process as smooth as possible, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository

To contribute to the project, you first need to create your own copy of the repository by forking it.

- Navigate to the GitHub repository page.
- Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.

### 2. Clone your fork

Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine to make changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bozaci/awesome-semantic-commit.git
```

### 3. Create a new branch

Create a new branch to work on your feature or fix. This keeps your changes separate from the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make your changes

Make your changes locally. Ensure that you follow the coding conventions and best practices of the project.

### 5. Write tests (if applicable)

If your changes introduce new features, or fix a bug, ensure that you write tests for your changes.

### 6. Commit your changes

Once you've made your changes, stage them and create a commit with a clear, concise message.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add/Update feature: brief description of changes"
```

### 7. Push your changes

Push your changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Open a pull request

After pushing your changes, go to the repository and create a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, ensure the following:

- **Descriptive pull request**: Provide a clear description of what your pull request does, why it's needed, and what problem it solves.
- **Referencing issues**: If your pull request addresses an existing issue, mention the issue number in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- **Code quality**: Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards. This includes proper indentation, variable naming, and documentation.
- **Tests**: If you've added new features or fixed bugs, ensure that relevant tests are in place and pass.

## Code Style

To maintain consistency, please follow these coding standards:

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Variable naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- **Comments**: Add comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.
- **No hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding values like API endpoints or credentials. Use environment variables instead.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please follow these steps:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if the bug has already been reported or fixed.
2. **Provide detailed information**: When reporting the bug, provide details like:
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots or error messages, if applicable
   - Your environment (e.g., browser, operating system)
